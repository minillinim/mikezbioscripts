These scripts work together to allow you to plot single or paired reads to
reference contigs.

Workflow:
1. makeSam.py
2. plotPipe.py

Dependencies:
1. R
2. Rpy2
3. pysam
4. bwa

Note:
Limit the number of reference contigs to a reasonable number or you will run
into errors such as "too many files open"
